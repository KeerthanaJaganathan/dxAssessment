The Palindrome Program is found in the file Palindrome.java



The Selenium script is created with the chrome driver and testNG as the base.
As I have executed the script in the mac OS the chromedriver will be added to the /usr/local/bin insted of adding it to the project directly.
Please do make the changes if the script is to be executed in the windows machine.

Also I have not used any of the properties file to read the url and the browsers because again the path of the properties file will be from the local directory.
