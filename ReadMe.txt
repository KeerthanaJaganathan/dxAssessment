For the entire Assessment I have used JAVA as the programming language

The Palindrome Program is found in the file Palindrome.java.
I have written as to get the input from the user then validate the string is a palindrome or not


Test automation is created with selenium with JAVA 1.8. Eclipse is the IDE that I have used for buiding the same.

The Selenium script is created with the chrome driver and testNG as the base having the page object model as the basic framework.
As I have executed the script in the mac OS the chromedriver will be added to the /usr/local/bin insted of adding it to the project directly.
Please do make the changes if the script is to be executed in the windows machine.

Also I have not used any of the properties file to read the url and the browsers because again the path of the properties file will be from the local directory.
